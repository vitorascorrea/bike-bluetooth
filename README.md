# Bike Bluetooth

## About
Fun project where my goal is to create a functional app that will _help me increase my time on my home exercise bike_. I'm learning about:

- Bluetooth LE devices and their protocols
- [Experimental bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API)
- [No build javascript & css](https://world.hey.com/dhh/you-can-t-get-faster-than-no-build-7a44131c)
- CI through Github Actions

Future plans include storing workout sessions client-side and gamifying the experience.
